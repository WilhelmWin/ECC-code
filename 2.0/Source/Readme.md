# Ascon Curve25519 DRNG Archive

This directory contains preserved source files related to the implementation of AEAD encryption (ASCON-128a) and elliptic curve cryptography (Curve25519), as well as supporting components such as a deterministic random number generator (DRNG). These files are part of a cryptographic experimentation and backup archive and are **not intended for direct compilation without integration**.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This archive was created as part of internal development and backup purposes.
- Files may originate from open-source cryptographic research repositories and may require external headers or build systems.
- Some of the sources (e.g., ASCON or DRNG components) may originate from reference implementations or academic repositories.
- Use and integration require appropriate understanding of cryptographic implementations and dependencies.
