# Secure Client-Server Communication Using ECC and Diffie-Hellman

## Overview

This project demonstrates secure communication between a server and a client using **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** and **Diffie-Hellman** key exchange. The server and client establish a shared secret using Diffie-Hellman, which is then used for message encryption and decryption. The communication is conducted over a TCP/IP connection, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged.

## Key Features

- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** for key generation and Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
- **Secure Communication** using a shared secret for encryption/decryption.
- **Custom Encryption Algorithm** (based on the Ascon algorithm).
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Windows and Linux.
- **Modular Codebase** using static libraries.
- **Graceful Termination** with a predefined "end word".

## Technologies Used

- ECC and Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- Custom encryption with Ascon
- TCP/IP socket communication (Winsock for Windows, standard sockets for Unix)
- C language with GCC and platform-specific Makefile

## File Descriptions

### Applications

- **`server.c`**: Initializes the server, generates ECC keys, establishes connection, performs Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and manages encrypted communication.
- **`client.c`**: Connects to the server, generates ECC keys, performs Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and handles encrypted message exchange.

### Cryptographic Modules

- **`keygen2.c` / `keygen2.h`**: Generates ECC private keys and random numbers.
- **`ECC.c` / `ECC.h`**: Contains core ECC operations and Diffie-Hellman computations.
- **`ASCON.c` / `ASCON.h`**: Implements encryption and decryption based on Ascon.
- **`drng.c` / `drng.h`**: Deterministic random number generation.
- **`common.c` / `common.h`**: Socket utilities, message handling, error reporting, etc.
- **`variables.h`**: Shared constants and macros.

## Building the Project

This project uses a **Makefile** that supports both Linux and Windows platforms. All source files are compiled using **GCC**. The Makefile automatically links the necessary static libraries and applies platform-specific flags.

### Makefile Features

- Builds static libraries: `libkeygen.a`, `libecc.a`, `libascon.a`, `libcommon.a`
- Cross-platform support (Windows uses `-lws2_32` for Winsock)
- Targets:
  - `make`: Builds all components
  - `make server`: Builds only the server
  - `make client`: Builds only the client
  - `make clean`: Removes object files and executables
  - `make distclean`: Removes all generated and backup files

## Linux/Unix Compilation

```bash
make
```
### To build only the server or client:

```bash
make server
make client
```
## Windows Compilation (MinGW or similar)
Make sure `make` and `gcc` are installed, then run:

```bash
make
```
ðŸ’¡ On Windows, the Makefile automatically links with `ws2_32` for Winsock support.

## Cleaning Build Artifacts

To clean compiled files:

```bash
make clean
```
To remove all build files including backups:

```bash
make distclean
```

## How to use?

Running the Applications

### Running the Server

```bash
./server <port_number>
```
The server will start and listen for incoming client connections on the specified port.

### Running the Client

```bash
./client <server_ip_address> <port_number>
```
The client connects to the server and begins secure communication using the shared secret key.

### Example Communication Flow

- Server generates its ECC private and public key.

- Client generates its ECC key pair.

- Both exchange public keys.

- Using Diffie-Hellman, they compute a shared secret.

- Messages are encrypted/decrypted using this shared secret.

- Communication continues until the predefined "end word" is sent to terminate.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure both server and client use the same port.

- Make sure public keys are exchanged before sending encrypted messages.

- Check firewall, IP address, and network configuration.

- On Windows, verify that Winsock is initialized properly.

- Use `make clean` and recompile if there are build issues.
